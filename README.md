# Challenge 6 Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze housing costs in San Francisco using Python, hvplot and Pandas.

## Data
We compare Sales Price per Square Foot against Average Gross Rent in San Francisco from 2010 to 2016.  We can see that sales prices are relatively stable in comparison to rents.

This remains true for most of the city with only a few outliers like the Union Square District.

Here we visualize the data on a map to give a better sense of price impacts across the city.

## Analysis
In the vast majority of neighborhoods sale prices are relatively stable in comparison to rental income growth. Union Square District is the only neighborhood that has shown a major spike in sale prices. This leaves most of the city ripe for rental property investment. A one-click buy and rent strategy should be an attractive strategy for the company based on this data.
